# aggragit
Aggragate "whole formed by combining several (typically disparate) elements."

## Resources

My education is from [google](https://www.google.com/).

## Usage
```python
# testing does not exist. This is for practice
import testing

# returns 'I prefer water'
testing.statepreference('water')
```
## Other Things
### Emphasis

Either _asterisk_\* or _underscore_\*  will create _italics_. If you mix the syntax, linter will throw an error. Good practice is _consistency_.

Double **asterisks** will create **boldface**.

\* Literal asterisks and underscores (e.g. attempt\_1) that are not used for italics need to follow a backslash.

### Block Quotes
> First line
> Another line
>
>> Nested line
>>
> Last Line

### Lists
* lift
* pull
* push

1. left
2. right
3. forward

### Code
Inline 'code' can be inserted by indenting with 4 spaces or with 3 backticks. I used backticks above. I'll stay consistent to please the linter.

```python
# or use 3 backticks and specify code in the fenced
import pandas as pd
```
### Nested Lists
* Clean
    1. data
    2. bedroom
    3. ears
* Check
  - attitude
  - work
  - boxes
* Close
